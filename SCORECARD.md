# lore scorecard — round 9

Owned axes: depth, coverage, calibration. Scores remain unassigned without a
quality rubric; row counts and exit codes are measurements, not scores or verdicts.

| axis | score | evidence / counting command | last change |
|---|---|---|---|
| depth | unmeasured | round 3: `python3 .shokunin/lore/corpus/fixtures/check_bible.py .shokunin/lore/corpus/fixtures/contradictions` → exit 1 with original three findings and validated two ledger pointers; `contradictions-ledger-malformed` → exit 1 with ledger-local unresolved event plus original three; outputs in `corpus/live/runs/20261012T162704Z/`; baseline report commit `ba110ea3495571ce027699dc9bfabc9d2912cffb` had no ledger; work commit in round-3 report | r3 |
| coverage | unmeasured | round 8: `python3 .shokunin/lore/corpus/fixtures/check_bible.py .shokunin/lore/corpus/fixtures/r8-deps-distinct` → exit 0; `r8-deps-anomalous` → exit 1 with indexed repeat/self + existing inversion; isolated repeated-earlier probe in `reports/r8-independent-verifier.md`; run output `corpus/live/runs/20261012T171326Z/`; baseline report commit `17736ae5ed260c4b99f98efd9b194254ccd2aa87` accepted repeated earlier dependency; work commit in round-8 report | r8 |
| calibration | unmeasured | round 9: `python3 .shokunin/lore/corpus/fixtures/check_bible.py .shokunin/lore/corpus/fixtures/r9-dup-low-high` and `r9-dup-high-low` → both exit 1 with the same duplicate-ID and indexed ambiguous dependency findings; `r9-unique-control` → exit 0; raw outputs `corpus/live/runs/20261012T172227Z/`; baseline report `9e1de5721c0ed6a1f2b8a5749dca07b6959be1f6` inferred an inversion in one duplicate-row order only; work commit in round-9 report | r9 |

planned: seek a separately falsifiable cited lore-depth or new coverage move; source-text support remains unverified. Round-4 duplicate-name detector remains rejected; no active name check or alias coverage.
retired: hard-failing exact duplicate names without sourced uniqueness; round 4 showed calibration harm. Scores unchanged because the round was rejected.
